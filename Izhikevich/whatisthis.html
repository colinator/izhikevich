<h3>The Izhikevich Neuron Simulator</h3>

<p>
This app simulates a single 'Izhikevich Neuron' across 1000 milliseconds. Although this neuron model is powerful and computationally efficient, its non-linear behavior makes it difficult to construct an intuitive understanding of it. Hopefully, this app can help!
</p>

<p>
<strong>Model Parameters:</strong> The Model Parameters pane, at the bottom of the screen, is used to set the a, b, c, and d parameters of the Izhikevich Neuron Model, along with the initial voltage (v<sub>0</sub>). Change these parameters and see the results in real-time! You can hide this pane by scrolling it down. Or: scroll the main view up!
</p>

<p>
<strong>Input:</strong> The Input dc-current pane shows the input to the model. You can draw an input directly in this pane, and again the output will update in real-time. Use the filter button on the right to hard-limit the input. Because most neurons in the brain respond not to direct physical input, but to other neurons, it's also useful to use the 'send spikes to input' function to turn neural spike output into input. For now, you can only create excitatory inputs.

<p>
<strong>Neuron Output:</strong> This pane shows the v and u model output in real-time. Very roughly speaking, v corresponds to output voltage of the neuron, and u is an internal state variable.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Phase Portrait:</strong> This pane shows the phase portrait of the model, which is a system of differential equations. The u nullcline parabolas are draw in in grey, the v nullcline in red, and the model output in blue. Zoom in to see more detail! Use the t slider to reveal the u nullcline (in green) for the given time, and corresponding model output (in magenta). This phase portrait will also change in real-time given parameter and input changes.

<strong>&#8669;:</strong> Reveals saved simulations. We've included the 20 'canonical' neuron behaviors according to Izhikevich. Some we cannot replicate! Create more as you wish.
